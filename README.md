All mass email software are paid. Mass mail sending requires professional accounts with mail providers like Yahoo and Google. These service providers, with free accounts, provide a capability of sending around 120 different emails in 1 hour, before freezing your mail send function for some hours.

RationalMassMailer allows you to control the rate of emails you send, to remain well within the limit imposed. You can send from 1 to 999 emails per hour. The cool part is you can modify the transmission rate any time. 

RationalMassMailer also allows you to pause and resume your mail transmission at any time during transmission. A window for second thought is always open. 

RationalMassMailer has tweaked the sending to remain well below the radar and exploit full features of your free email account.

Always suggest to take out code, read and compile on your own, because you put your password to connect to your email and compromised copy of the code will let hackers to steal your credentials. Also never believe, if anyone provides this function in a browser-based application.

RationalMassMailer is desktop based GUI interface that makes the work easy and safe for you. If you don't want to compile, visit my portal at www.rationalminds.net for an executable copy. Again a word of caution, match the signatures of the file before you use it.
