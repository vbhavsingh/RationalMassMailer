# RationalMassMailer
All mass email softwares are paid. Mass mail sending requires professional accounts with mail providers like yahoo and google. These service providers, with free acounts provide capability of sending around 120 different emails in 1 hour, before freezing your mail send function for some hours.

RationalMassMailer has tweaked the sending to remain well below radar and expolit full features of your free email account.

Always suggest to take out code, read and compile on your own, because you put your password to connect to your rmail and compromozed copy of code will let hackers to steal your credentials. Also never belive, if any one provides this function on a browser based application.

RationalMassMailer is desktop based GUI interface thats makes the work easy and safe for you. If you dont want to compile, visit my portal at www.rationalminds.net for exectable copy. Again word of caution, match the signatures of file before you use it.
